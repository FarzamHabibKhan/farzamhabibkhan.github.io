## Farzam Habib Khan


## Principles

## Features

This is a two column theme with a navbar at the top and a sidebar to the right. The navbar contains links to major pages and links to social networks. The sidebar contains an about section, a section with the last 10 posts and finally a section which lists tags used across your site.

### Beautiful tables and images through purecss.

   Name | Age
--------|------
    Bob | 27
  Alice | 23

### Syntax highlighting by pygments

Set your pygments theme by setting,

    pygmentsCodeFences = "true"
    pygmentsStyle = "perldoc"

Example highlighted code,

{{< highlight html >}}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Example HTML5 Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Test</p>
</body>
</html>
{{< /highlight >}}

###Â Feature images in archives
Setting the image parameter in the yaml header sets a feature image which is displayed in the articles section.

### Comments by disqus

To enable comments, set your `disqusShortname` in config.toml. This will make comments appear on all single article pages. This bit of code is located at `layouts\_default\single.html`.

### Social

To enable a link to a social network in the header (top-right), enter the url. To disable it, just comment it out. This bit of code is located at `layouts\partials\menu.html`.

## Configuration
